so after further investigation i believe this is what im going to be buying  http  www and http  www thanks for your input guysgals 
i m in the market for a bike right now and would  gladly  take a free one  edit  word
vintage  working  bulletproof bike for free  oh  and your dad wants to ride with you  what more could anyone ask for 
same story here  i started shopping for bikes and at first i wanted an r3  or anything fullyfaired racing type of bike  then i realized i only had  300 to spend on a bike and while i hated lowriders  i ended up buying a honda vt500c because it was the closest to a standard i could find in that price range  fast forward to today  i love it in my experience  once a bike becomes yours you will love it  
one of me  one of me congratulations on the striple man you will not be disappointed  
i do nt get all the harley hate the newer ones are pretty damn smooth and sound amazing i do nt need to go insanely fast to have fun on two wheels  
 this might help you out it s a cafe racer guide but it also provides insight into how to get the most out of honda cb s   http  docsgooglecomfiled0b6fh3f6hufhdckm2ektbcdrfnwsedit 
take your local safetylicense course this will give you time in the saddle and the opportunity to gain confidence 
that s beautiful 
i felt the same way before i got the licence i said fuck it and did the course anyway me and my gf did it together and had a blast once i got home and got on that bike  all the fear faded away  i just ride reasonably and literally ride like i am totally invisible wear the proper gear and look out for left turners  my biggest fear now is getting rear ended at a stop light i stay towards the painted line between cars and watch my mirror until i know the car behind me has stopped  trust me man you will not be afraid out there you ll be in control 
just do the msf even if you do it and decide that riding is not for you  you will be a better driver for it  more aware of riders around you  checking lanes more closely and more it s a great experience and you get to learn in a safe environment just pull the trigger on this small expense  megagateway experience to riding 
does anybody know of any gas cans that could either be mounted or strapped down to the tail of a motorcycle  i have a bmw f650 funduro with a full luggage kit however  i do nt like riding with the helmet case and i feel like that could be a great place to strap any extra gas can to if anyone has any suggestions or ideas  please join the conservation  thank you
i originally was going to buy this 2009 ninja 250 with 23k miles for  1500 great deal but i was too late http  fortmyerscraigslistorgleemcd5435069967html but they also have this 2001 honda vt 750 im not sure on milage but its only  1000 would this be a good beginner bike  do you think i could potentially make a profit on it  http  fortmyerscraigslistorgleemcd5435083510html thanks everyone 
for christmas  my wife got me my first bike  a 98 yamaha 600r previous to this  i had been riding my brother s honda gt 250  i posted my gift here  http  www i have taken my new  bike into the shop and i m sporting new tires  maintenance looks good  and i installed new frame sliders additionally  i was able to pick up some good motorcycle pants from revzilla on closeout  after riding around my town s inner streets and back roads getting a feel for handling  clutch  friction zone and all that  today was the day i took my first trip on the highway at 75mph  and my first time breaking 60mph   i was a little apprehensive at first these speeds were up there  compared to what i was used to  and i was nervous about all the traffic around me i had decided to stick to the far right lane so i only had my right side to keep an eye on another rider whom i had spoken with had helped ease my anxiety when i had expressed myself earlier he had said  it s faster  yes  but you will flow with the traffic much like you do at the lower speeds you just have to keep that in mind  he was right so today  i merged onto interstate 25 and wow  going from a 250 to a 600 was nuts i will freely admit i was taking every off ramp that came along just so i could merge back on again and here i thought my brother s bike had some oomph to it i did nt even realize i had a huge grin plastered on my face until i let off the throttle at 85mph  weather permitting  i m going to ride into work this friday  casual day  and this weekend i fully intend to find that group of bikers i saw on sunday riding around town i just hope they ll be ok with me joining them  tldr  riding motorcycles is amazing
italy  spain  southern france  greece are more than drivable during winter as long as you do nt mind the occasional rain it is very nice  with an european passport you can also go without too much hassle to morocco or turkey those are wonderful places  both on road and offroad  but maybe the desert has a bigger allure for an euro than an aussie   that s just for the deepest winter the rest of the year you can go wherever you want 
southern europe is ok all year mostly  northern not so much current temperature in denmark is below 0c most days 
i live in the lake district  far northern england  expect it to be less than 10 degrees  people go to the beach when it hits 15 degrees here  i ve been riding between 17 degrees this week and it s tolerable  just get some good gear and heated grips or gloves  i personally do nt ride if it s freezing conditions  but it s not often that bad just expect rain about 90  of the time if you come to england haha 
lol that just made me remember my first time on a highway i know that feel 
just road 15 minutes to uni in 1  c this morning  could have taken the tram and it would have also taken 15 minutes ride the bike because it s fun and do nt let the weather ruin your day  no heated gear or grips for me but i m sure it makes it more comfortable wear more layers  realize that grip is lower than usual and you are fine as long as no ice is on the road if ice is on the road park it take public transportation it s great in europe in most places 
i understood your question that you ll be living in france  but want to explore the rest of the continent while you re here  how long will you be here  in the case that you re here for a year or more  you can do it with just a motorcycle you just need to explore the mountains and northern areas during the summer  and save the mediterranean coast for the winter months even now  northern switzerland does nt have any snow and it is just above freezing i took a  trip into germany   http  dantesdamecommainawinterweekendride  last weekend it was damn cold and wet  but doable  as anywhere  there are two factors  local climates and inconsistent weather patterns this year was light on snow  but next year could swing the other way  and of course  good gear goes a looong way to extending your riding season 
have a look at the revit h2out line  but honestly  a touring textile suit will be better in every way 
an empty onramp into empty highway is a beautiful thing i love being at highway speeds before i m even close to merging 
that area of france will be fine you may get the odd snow day but it wo nt settle for months like it does in northern europe or in parts of the us  plenty of people  including myself commute all year round in the uk  the key is decent winter riding gear plastic over suits are the most cost effective but goretex is king  if you want to enjoy riding in the winter  you ll end up spending almost as much on riding gear as you will the bike bare that in mind 
i own both waterproof armor jeans and textiles for anything longer than 1h i prefer the textiles  they are simply more versatile having liners and all that also having a fitting jacket that zips onto the trousers help tons with keeping warm  additionaly my textiles have 4 zip pockets whilst my jeans have the standart  no zip  jeans pockets 
looks great  now i want a vinyl cutter 
i love honda s motorcycle logo
yup  they are great  i posted just a couple of days ago after rebadging my bike
