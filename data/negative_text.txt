i took my exhaust system off so i could put it on my bike lift for the winter i was trying to put the system back on this morning and realized that the gasket rings that sit between the block and the beginning of the headers just rests between them the rings are metal and they do nt fit tightly in the recess of the exhaust ports  nor do headers have a lip to keep them on  i was able to get a couple on by just working from one end  but without an extra set of hands to lift up the bottom of the exhaust  the final 2 rings kept falling out any ideas on how to prevent this 
they will just cut the chain it will stop casual thieves but it wo nt stop a determined experienced bike thief 
they are nt going to screw around with whatever the chain is anchored to  they will just cut the chain with a battery grinder so do nt go too overboard on what you are anchoring to  disc lock  with alarm   chain  and do nt get a ducati if you re parking it in plain site  get insurance that covers you for theft and accept that there are some things beyond your control the aim is nt to make your bike unstealable  its just to make it difficult enough that it s easier to steal someone else s
probably makes a lot less hp without the muffler also backfiring  and you need to be careful it does nt lean out the fuelair ratio leading to overheating  etc do nt ride it like that 
ask your surgeon  who will likely recommend not riding at all if you insist  you ll need hard shell  strap on full back protection intended for racing  none of that in the jacket crap 
suck it up better to learn on an old shitty bike before you buy your own because you might end up dumping it

http  imgurcomtvbgeur sorry i do nt use reddit much i m a noob  please look at the picture  i dropped me helmet upside down right on the push knob that lowers the sunvisor  it s made of plastic so the knob fell out and the track cracked  i crazy glued it back in but i doubt it will hold  has anyone had this problem before  it really sucks i love this helmet spent  250 on it  the sun visor is so damn handy i ca nt imagine life without it  now it s virtually useless because a tiny little plastic piece cracked amp  fell out  in the picture you push the knob on the left forward to drop the visor  then you push the knob on the right down to bring it back up  spring loaded   the knob on far right is an air vent  is there any hope or am i up the creek  thanks for your help 
one of your assumptions is wrong we all like to concentrate on that type of accident where the biker is riding along minding his own business and out of nowhere comes a lunatic in a car who kills him of course that can and does happen  but in  too  many many accidents the biker is partly to blame according to david hough  proficient motorcycling  40  of motorcycle fatalities had a bac of 010  or above in addition  way too many bikers ride way too fast and careless for traffic conditions  you have only to check youtube to verify that there are also too many new bikers and returning bikers who do nt get proper instruction those are the catagories of bikers who are highly represented in the fatality and serious injury columns avoid those things and you have heavily slanted the odds in your favor do nt drink  drug  and ride  do nt ride like an idiot  and get all the instruction and practice you can and you will not guarantee your survival but you can count on it being a pretty unlikely event that might get you 
i know that question sounds weird  but i have the same problem every year taxes come around  start getting hyped for the warm months  then the thought starts to cross my mind to finally get a bike i start to plan everything out  take some days off  start getting information from local msf courses  glue my eyes to craigslist  etc and then  like clockwork  some gruesome video or story pops up about some rider getting creamed by a car  no fault of their own  and i immediately rethink the decision just the thought of riding excites me but the fear of getting into an unavoidable accident always drives me away how do i get over this feeling  or what did it take for those in a similar situation 
the fear or innate feeling of uncertainty is nt something that goes for me do i fear that which i have no control over  sure but it s up to me to be ruled by it or to own it and do with it what i will since in the same vein you have no control over your body  while its not common you could goto sleep tonight and never wake up  brain aneurysm  heart failure  etc the same things that happen on a motorcycle can happen in a car you could get swiped by a kid in his sweet lifted truck and end up 6 feet under  honestly there s no real way to say do this and this and it wo nt bother you in my opinion i would nt want to be oblivious to the dangers being oblivious or ruled by them makes for poor judgement and oftentimes does more damage than understanding and using this fear as motivation to be better  vigilant  perceptive and proactive about your safety  how long it takes you to get to that point is all up to you man  good luck  hope to see you with some wheels soon 
in paris and berlin i saw these ridiculous neoprene mittens attached to the handle bars of scooters they were handwarmers thats how cold it is also you have to worry about black ice hell you even have to worry about that in australia 
terrible idea you wo nt want to do a damn thing after  and you sure as heck do nt want to do anything to promote bleeding  ie  anything active   i do nt want to imagine what pulling a helmet on would feel like 
hey guys  i m moving to france  aixenprovence  from australia in september and intend to travel as much of europe as i can when i get over there  for transport i pretty much have the options of either buying a bike or a vanwagon etc  now  i love cold weather  but i just realised how cold europe gets in winter and i m having doubts about the bike idea  are there any people here who have personally ridden in europe who could share their opinions on riding through autumnwinter  tips  bikegear suggestions  is snow really that bad  i have a belgian passport and intend to see as much as i can  so all regions of europe are relevant  the only people feeding me ideas and information are people who do nt ride  but just say that it would surely be too cold  please convince me to get a bike and not a van for obvious reasons  
when you say cold weather how cold you you mean  honestly  if you have to ask it s probably not a good idea  like others said  southern europe is ok  italy  spain  greece  parts of france the catch is the alps if you want to go anywhere interesting  sooner or later you re going to cross some mountains and this is not just hard  it s simply impossible the alps in winter are dangerous by car  let alone with a motorcycle  in many countries it s actually illegal to drive without winter tires  ie there is an expectation that at some point the roads will be completely covered in snow  so  if you want to ride  rent a bike in italy or spain and have plenty of fun anywhere else  drive something with winter tires 
i agree it could have been your cam chain that went that would explain the rattling noise you initially heard and the sudden  snap  when the chain finally gave away and a piston slammed into a valve  for a quick check you could try pulling the spark plugs and seeing if either of them have damage on the ends it is nt uncommon for the spark plug to also be damaged when this happens 
gt  anyone have insight into what might have gone wrong   yes what went wrong is quoted below  gt  i asked a friend what it might be  and he said it was one of the cables riding up against the engine  causing resonance he told me it was no big deal  and if i keep riding it would go away  gt  i had been riding in the rain and harsh weather for most of the past few months i m sure it did nt help it did nt have anything to do with this i had an ex500 that i rode rain or shine for 10 years rode it through pretty much everything but snow it did nt contribute to your engine failure 
cross post this on ex500com and stop paying people to do work you re capable of and do nt give me shit about no tools you paid a guy 1k and have nothing to show for it you ll need those tools now to part it out 
like others said  it probably valvecam related hard starting can be a sign  at least on single cylinders  of tight valves you could have smashed a valve into the piston  or rattling can be a sign of busted cam chain tensioner  and your cam chain snapped  causing valve into piston carnage could be a lot of bad things  frankly  its time for an engine swap which is actually a very easy process as long as you are careful this can be done with mostly basic tools  patience  and a garage to work in all you need to find is a suitable donor engine   like this   http  www  hash  item210a37f6df  g  3piaaoswb4nwwxvwamp  vxp  mtr  more involved process would be a top end rebuild  pull the valve covers and see what you find before paying a mechanic another dime  oh and do nt listen to your friend anymore  he sounds unhelpful  edit  fyi  engine swap would also replace transmission so technically you do nt need to fully diagnose and pinpoint the issue to get back riding
