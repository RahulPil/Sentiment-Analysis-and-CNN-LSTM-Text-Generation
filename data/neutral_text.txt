i know i am going to get some flame from the atgatt community for this  but here it goes  i have been steadily acquiring protective gear and now regularly ride with a leather motorcycle jacket  helmet  and gloves kevlar jeans are next on my list  however  i solely ride in leather work boots  soft toe   and i am not prepared  re  do nt want to  to have to carry around a pair of motorcycle boots everywhere i ride i have found several products that provide ankle protection  braces  that i can wear under my work boots  but not a lot of community feedback on them does anyone have some experience with them or has a better alternative minus dedicated motorcycle boots 
the smallest amount of grease as glue smallest 
get the insurance  read the bike thief ama  and use as many security contraptions as you can 
a dab of antiseize 
so  i am buying a new bike next month as i live in nyc  i am terrified of it being stolen i do nt have a private driveway  renting a spot will be more per month than insurance and bike payment combined  and there is no storage facilities within reasonable distance i figured i could make my own security mount by mixing a five gallon bucket of concrete with either a hole for a chain being set with a pipe  or setting the chain in the concrete itself i could then use one or two of those contraptions when i lock it up at night  thoughts 
the only effective security money can buy is insurance 
 
are you kidding me  i do nt care what it is  if it has two wheels and its free  i d take it 
that was nt a tornado  it was tropical storm pee wee 
this thread is ice cold  lol 
i d like something in the realm of a shadow 650vstar 650 or some other bike that you would recommend i honestly do nt want to spend more than 1500  maybe 1700  1200 sounds like a nice unrealistic number to me  any help  also i m really only looking for cruisers  i ve never been a fan of sportbikes 
i use a dab of liquid gasket 
just a touch of grease on one small spot just enough to hold it then  ignore the smoke for a while 
i mean i can fire up the old external and send you some car crash photos that i promise exceed anything you ve ever seen involving a motorcycle will that make you give up your car  i m guessing no so the next step is take the msf course as familiarity will ease your nerves 
you can limit your risk a lot of accidents happen at night so do nt ride at night a lot of accidents happen in rain and on ice do nt ride when the weather is bad a lot of accidents involve aggressive riding do nt ride aggressively other accidents involve lane splitting  do nt lane split you ca nt make motorcycling perfectly safe this way  but you can eliminate around 80  of the risk 
either do nt ride on the street and go do track stuff  or take what happens to them and learn as much as you can  move on keep it in the back of your mind  remember  only the spectacles make it to the internet  not the thousands of rides a day people do without incident  it s like plane crashes everyone thinks small aircraft go down by the thousand but  not the case 
i was also very scared for my safty i actually had buyer s remorse after my purchase what i did was to get life insurance for the just in case it helped put my mind at ease you ca nt live your life indoors and in fear riding a motorcycle is my church i feel so relaxed when i m in the zone

patience  saw you commented that you want a sports bike keep on waiting imo for that bike  otherwise youll be looking to upgrade change bikes to what you wanted fairly quickly 
i warm my 81 up by riding it 
 you need a slip in db killer   http  www  var  amp  hash  item1c49a35bb0  m  m47ng5kssbprj_vjvodyka   they hold in place with a small bolt if you invert the bolt  you do not need to drill the exhaust  however  once in  they will alter back pressure  so fueling will be thrown off with carbs most efis can adjust mine actually runs better with the baffle in  if bothering the neighbors is a real concern  do nt idle the bike at all or just leave the baffle in  because when you leave you will be making a racket anyway 
i have an sv650 with vance and hines exhaust that is throaty without being obnoxious however  i commute on it and since i have to leave fairly early to work i feel a bit bad letting it idlewarm up while my neighbors are sleeping  its a 99 with carbs so yes it needs to warm up  now it seems that i ve seen a gif from behind the bike where the rider removes something from the exhaust outlet  blips the throttle  and out pops a little baffle i want one so does anyone know if a slipin or clipin temporary baffle is a thingif they exist  the idea being i would let my bike idle with the exhaust restricted  then pull the baffle when i take off any ideas 
yes look at all of the trackrace oriented sites some tracks require db killers 
yep  a lot of mufflers have a built in bolt hole for them  although some do nt have provisions for a baffle so you might have to do some custom work

my brother went through them and got a better interest rate than he would have otherwise  i think less than 3  vs gt  56   i m not sure if he paid less for the bike itself though
i do nt know how this works but years ago  while my uncle was stationed in korea  he bought his harley and it was significantly cheaper than buying it stateside

i life in the netherlands and england is our shield if the brits are freezing and covered in snow  we are just a bit cold if the wind comes from the west  if it comes from the south  france and belgium catch the worst of it east and germany gets it full before we do  the point of this is that it completely depends where in europe you are even in my country  i have nt noticed anything but it being cold while ne of me they had several days of ijzel  frozen rain  the streets literally turned into ice   your area is on the bloody mediterranean sea it will be completely different experience then those exprerienced in say the nw of france where they get both the full force of atlantic storms but also the warming effect of the ocean  http  europabuienradarnlverwachtingtemperatuur temp map of europe for the coming days see how there are cold blue spots in the middle of otherwise warm areas  but your spot should often be comfortable to ride mind you  if you come from one of those  the ground burns  parts of australia  you might still find it cold but i can ride comfortably as long as it is above zero below zero you definitely need to either ride short trips  30 minutes  or start to seriously layer up  two pairs of pyamas in my case 
freeways are much safer than city streets everybody is going in the same direction at more or less the same speed and opposing traffic is separated with a barrier also traffic can only join or leave at clearly marked and controlled points always riding in the far right lane means you have to be very observant about onramp traffic the real dangers are on city streets and undivided 2lane highways 
just wait until you get enough experience under your belt and hit the twisties a spirited canyon ride is like nothing else in the world

so i have a 2000 ninja 500r i got her for  500  but she had been sitting in a garage for  5 years i had the shop run a full inspection and put about  1000 work into her  new tires  brake pads  etc  to get her up and running she had less than 30k km on her  and for a few months everything seemed fine  the first minor issue i noticed was when she had some trouble starting some mornings it d take a few tries  and sometimes you had to wait a few minutes  but i could always get her to start  one time  as well  when trying to start her  there was a loud  pop  sound  immediately followed by her starting i was nt sure what had just happened  so i looked the bike over  eventually figured that it was okay  and rode off  things were fine for a long time after that  at least six or so weeks without an issue then  more recently  she was having trouble starting again then  just a few days before she died  the engine cylinders were making rather loud rattling noises when i was riding i asked a friend what it might be  and he said it was one of the cables riding up against the engine  causing resonance he told me it was no big deal  and if i keep riding it would go away  well a couple days after  and the cylinders were still rattling then  in the middle of the road  the bike just dies on me it felt like a sudden  snap  and suddenly the engine would nt start  or even attempt to start   i thought it might have been the chain coming loose or breaking  but that was not the case  so now the mechanic believes it to be an engine or transmission issue  likely going to cost more than the bike is worth to fix  so she s probably going to be scrapped and sold for parts now instead  anyone have insight into what might have gone wrong  i ll also mention  i had been riding in the rain and harsh weather for most of the past few months i m sure it did nt help  but i m just trying to figure out what went wrong 
if the mechanic ca nt distinguish between motor and transmission  start with a new mechanic may be a snapped cam chain  which may or may not be terminal 
ok  long story short i m looking into getting a 2016 indian scout sixty this would be my first time buying a new vehicle so my question is are there any tips to lower the price or maybe pitfalls i should look out for

brit here i ride all year in the south of england  with winter trips to the north of england  but not normally scotland in winter   i ve been riding about 36 years  and i can only think of one week where i had to give up and take the bus  although obviously this depends on being somewhere where any snow is either slushy or is ploughed away promptly however snow is not very common these days as compared with 1020 years back generally winter is either cool and wet  or cold and dry decent waterproofs are a requirement  expect to spend about 600  for a good goretex jacket  or about 25x that for top end jacket like rukka   and you might want to look in to getting a heated waistcoat  keis are a reasonable make   i ve not found any boots that i can be sure will last  but i m using dainese trqtour at the moment and they seem to be waterproof and comfortable so far  i would hate to live in provence without access to a bike i sometimes fly down and hire a car to go walking in haut provence  never had time to ride down the scenery can be spectacular i ve generally visited in november due to my working year  and the climate was mild and dry as aix is a bit nearer the sea  i d expect it to be warmer in winter if anything  someone suggested buying a car as a backup that will be expensive just hire a car or a van when you need it  much cheaper 
i live in the south of sweden i start riding in march and usually put it away somewhere at the end of november  beginning of december  for most people though  the season starts april 1st and ends october 30th 
not european  but given the feedback  get a decent bike and a cheap backup  1000 car for snow days 
there is no way to lower the price of a bike from a dealer however what you can do is get them to throw things in gear  upgrades  my r3 purchase gets me 20  off gear  and they through in racetech fork springs 
north of france i would not recommend it  europe does have good public transport  you know look into the interrail card 
gt  he told me it was no big deal  and if i keep riding it would go away  let this be a lesson unexplained noises do nt generally start for no reason and should nt be left to just  go away 
i just got a 125 motorcycle used  and i ve realised a few things  for once  the front brake is strange  when i pass the free play on the lever and start applying the brakes  if i keep my hand applying always the same pressure  the bike s suspension loads and unloads repeateadly  almost like if i was applying the brakes  releasing them and reaplying can you guys help me out  another thing is the chain is nt an oring chain  the owner told me he replaced the chain because the old one was worn  i know a nonoring chain doesnt hold lube very well  so when should i apply lubeclean it or should i just replace it asap  the bike has 12000 km  7500 miles  and is 6 years old thank you
kevlar jeans are  riding around town  gear for people who want some protection go with textile or leather for touring 
you have a few options  there is the revit orlandomemphis which are waterproof as they have a bonded hydratex liner but maybe not the best if its going to be hot weather for good protection jeans i would look at  hood   http  www  as they have a full liner and also different ce level armours you can pick 
ahhh  i remember that day well  it was winter but sunny and i figured  hey  it ca nt be that cold at 70mph  i do nt need to wear gloves or have a leather jacket on  wrong 
with the low temps i could live  but but here in austria with black ice  gravel  leaves  salt and occasionally snow on the road the conditions for safe riding are nt really given  i rode all year in school times with my 50cc bike  but i layed it down some times in really low speed because of black ice  i do nt know the winter in the provence  but it could be better there
