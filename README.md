# Sentiment-Analysis-and-CNN-LSTM-Text-Generation
CNN-LSTM-Text-Generation
An implementation of two models, a regular recurrent neural network (LSTM) and a reccurent neural network with a layer of convolution (CNN-LSTM), for character based text generation combined with sentiment analysis to generate text based on a specific sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using the roBERTa model and Pytorch neural network layers.
Accuracy of the text generation model is tested through the BLEU score.
